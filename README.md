## 👋 Hi, I’m Asma — the human behind Cirlyxa

I’m a returning student and future cybersecurity engineer building my skills in:

- 🛡️ Network security & incident response  
- 🧪 Home labs with Kali, Debian, Fedora & virtual machines  
- 🌐 DNS, firewalls, Pi-hole, and traffic analysis  
- ☁️ Cloud & intro to DevOps tools  
- 🎧 Past life: DJ → now remixing packets instead of tracks  

---

## 🌌 What I’m working on right now

- 🧱 **Home Cyber Lab** – multi-VM lab with Kali & Debian
- 🚫 **Ad-blocking & DNS privacy** – Pi-hole, custom rules, Safari extension ideas
- 🌍 **Networking fundamentals** – subnetting, VLANs, Wireshark, routing
- 🎓 **Cert path** – CCNA + Security+ + future cloud certs
